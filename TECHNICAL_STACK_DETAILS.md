# Technical Stack Details

This document provides a detailed overview of the technical stack, outlining the purpose of each component within the application and the technology used to fulfill that purpose.

## Frontend

### Purpose: User Interface
**Technology: React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.

### Purpose: State Management
**Technology: Redux (optional for MVP)** - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, which may be used if the application state management becomes complex.

### Purpose: Styling
**Technology: Styled-Components** - Utilizes tagged template literals to style components directly within component logic.

### Purpose: Type Checking
**Technology: TypeScript** - A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions, enhancing code quality and understandability.

## Backend

### Purpose: Server Environment
**Technology: Node.js** - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, suitable for building scalable network applications.

### Purpose: API
**Technology: Express.js** - A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

### Purpose: Authentication
**Technology: Passport.js** - Middleware for Node.js that simplifies the process of handling authentication.

### Purpose: Data Validation
**Technology: Joi / Yup** - Libraries that allow schema descriptions for JavaScript objects to validate body, params, and query.

## Database

### Purpose: Data Storage
**Technology: PostgreSQL** - An open-source relational database with an emphasis on standards compliance and extensibility.

### Purpose: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
**Technology: Sequelize / TypeORM** - These are ORMs that can be used to bridge the gap between the relational PostgreSQL database and the backend.

## Hosting

### Purpose: Application Deployment
**Technology: Heroku** - A cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages that is used as a web application deployment model.

## Version Control

### Purpose: Code Repository
**Technology: Git** - A distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

### Purpose: Repository Hosting
**Technology: GitHub** - A Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface and access control and several collaboration features.

## Additional Tools

### Purpose: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
**Technology: GitHub Actions / CircleCI** - These tools help automate your software build, test, and deployment processes.

### Purpose: Code Formatting and Linting
**Technology: ESLint / Prettier** - Tools for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
