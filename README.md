### MVP-Focused Project Overview:

**Objective:**
To develop a streamlined and effective MVP for an online flash card service that facilitates English and Polish language learning, with a foundation built on modularity and TypeScript for robustness and scalability.

**MVP Core Features:**

- **User Management:** Essential roles for Admin, Teacher, and Student, with straightforward profile management.
- **Flash Cards:** Core functionality to create, view, and manage a basic set of flash cards with English and Polish terms.
- **Access Control:** Simple public and private settings for flash card sets to validate the content access model.
- **Testing and Assessment:** Fundamental testing features such as word matching and basic quizzes to establish the learning efficacy.
- **Progress Tracking:** Basic tracking of user progress to understand user engagement and learning outcomes.

**Technical Essentials:**

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, utilizing TypeScript for improved code reliability and maintenance.
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, ensuring a consistent and maintainable codebase with a focus on modularity.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for robust data management and relational data structures, which align with the educational content model.
- **Hosting:** A scalable hosting solution like Heroku to support the MVP phase and early growth.

**Modularity:**
A modular codebase to facilitate future expansion and maintenance, allowing individual features to be updated or improved without impacting the entire system.

### Development Strategy:

- Implement an agile development approach, focusing on delivering a functional MVP that provides core learning and testing capabilities.
- Ensure clean code practices and a well-organized project structure that supports modularity and ease of future development.

### Future Considerations:

- **Expanded Content Management:** Advanced features for creating and editing flash card sets, including multimedia content like audio clips and sample sentences.
- **Enhanced Access Control:** Development of a certification process for public content and premium access options.
- **Diverse Testing Methods:** Introduction of more sophisticated testing mechanisms based on pedagogical research.
- **Advanced Progress Tracking:** Implementation of comprehensive analytics and predictive models to tailor the learning experience.
- **Cross-Platform App:** Conversion of the web application into a native mobile experience.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Transition to a cloud infrastructure designed for larger-scale growth.
